| September 24 | 11-11:30am |        I built a linear search algorithm, then I tried building a binary search algorithm that wasn't working by the end of the half hour. I don't have a good idea on how to solve this. Maybe some kind of map for lookups? Maybe a tree storing all the words? |
| September 24 |  2-2:30pm  | I spoke with kids in class to float around ideas. Our best ideas at the moment are hash tables, some sort of map, or a tree that stores objects that hold information about valid words. I'll probably start by trying the tree approach? Not sure at the moment. |
