I don't have a good idea on how to solve this. Maybe some kind of map for lookups? Maybe a tree storing all the words? |

Our best ideas at the moment are hash tables, some sort of map, or a tree that stores objects that hold information about valid words. I'll probably start by trying the tree approach? Not sure at the moment. |

Currently, my code doesn't give any errors, but it does flag every word as incorrect. I can't find the source of the issue at the moment. |

At the moment, it's detecting every word as invalid, and IDK why. Probably an issue with the lookup() method. |

I'm passing about half the test cases now, because of timeouts. |

Sped up the code by keeping track of all valid words checked and checking that before checking the full dictionary TST. Passing all test cases with some room to spare. |
| October 6    |  2-2:30pm  | I tried speeding it up more by adding words in a random order instead of going alphabetically, but it took too long to set that up and ultimately made the program slower. I then tried speeding it up by adding the words in a binary search sort of manner, where I added the middle word, added the middle of each of the new halves. The goal was that the TST would be roughly equal size in most paths, which should speed up the lookups. This is a slight bit faster. I lose some time importing the words, since I'm still doing a pass over all words at the end, but it's not an unreasonable cost and it speeds up the lookups pretty significantly. |
